In addition is a suite of functionality easing the work of a dietitian in terms of templates at various levels and a solid CRM system. This results in word templates, external calculation systems and some administrative systems being redundant and the replacing components smarter. The system is now in use at Di√¶tisthuset and is currently being modified to use by other companies and individual dietitians. ",
